The scope of this project is to gain a high-level oversight of the exports and imports of Ireland to the outside world. 
The main reason to carry out this study is to identify the strengths of Ireland with other countries when it comes to imports & exports,
and to deal the possible damage caused by Brexit. 

Our main goal was to explore the strengths of Irelandâ€™s imports and exports, by commodity and country. Considering Great Britain leaving 
the European Union, reports of additional taxes, delays, and other checks/certificates, we wanted to see if we could identify new markets 
to replace GB if needed. 

We planned to create a presentation aimed at business owners and the public. The presentation is hosted on Tableau public and has enough 
information & interactivity that it can be further explored by interested parties if necessary.
